				I've attended <i><a href="http://www.bhavansnird.com/" target="_blank"><b>Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Vidyasharam</b></a></i> from 2000-07. 
				It was a small school nestled in the campus of NIRD, Hyderabad and is affiliated to CBSE. </p>
				
				<p>During my days at this school, I had the chance to represent it at various National level Olympiads and Quiz competitions. 
				My team secured the Second place in a State Level Quiz competition conducted by <i>Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources</i> in 2006. 
				I wasn't the best sportsperson in my class, but was fortunate enough to represent my School in a inter-school Cricket match.</p>

				I was involved with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bharat_Scouts_and_Guides" target="_blank">
				<i>Bharat Scouts and Guides</i></a>, the national Scouting and Guiding association of India, between the years 2004 and 2005. 
				It was a very rewarding volunteering experience that I would cherish for a long time. </p>
				
				<p>The most cherished memory that I have at <i>Bhavan's</i> is that I had been nominated as the 
				<b><i>Best all-round performer</i></b> of the graduating batch of 56 students.</p>
				
				<p>I graduated from this school with a 78.6% aggregate.</p>
				
				<p>I later completed by Intermediate Education at <i><b>Sri Chaitanya Jr. Kalasala</b></i> and graduated with a 89.6% aggregate in 2009. </p>
